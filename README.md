# ResearchDataHumanities
This workshop is designed to introduce some ways of working with data in the humanities by transforming sources into machine-readable formats. We will learn ways to organize data and explore some of the main digital methods.

Caterina Agostini led this workshop on 19 November 2020 at the Rutgers Digital Humanities Initiative and Lab.
